- [Add oplog to snap mongodb](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/79ffb7d50202471c7b7f297286f13e66ce30922e). Thanks to xet7.

and fixes the following bugs with Apache I-CLA, thanks to bentiss:

- [Fix swimlanes sorting](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/2174)
  since "[Properly fix horizontal rendering on Chrome and Firefox](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/7cc185ac)".
  The rendering of the new design of the swimlanes was correct, but this
  commit broke the reordering capability. Having the swimlane header at
  the same level than the lists of cards makes the whole sortable
  pattern fail.
  - 2 solutions:
    - revert to only have 1 div per swimlane. But this introduces [the firefox
      bug mentioned](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/7cc185ac), so not ideal
    - force the sortable pattern to do what we want.
  - To force the sortable pattern, we need:
    - add in the helper a clone of the list of cards (to not just move the
      header)
    - make sure the placeholder never get placed between the header and the
      list of cards in a swimlane
    - fix the finding of the next and previous list of cards.
    For all of this to be successful, we need to resize the swimlanes to a
    known value. This can lead to some visual jumps with scrolling when you
    drag or drop the swimlanea. I tried to remedy that by computing the new
    scroll value. Still not ideal however, as there are still some jumps when
    dropping.
    Fixes [#2159](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/2159).

  [Fix: Not displaying card content of public board: Snap, Docker and Sandstorm Shared Wekan Board

# v2.14 2019-02-02 Wekan release

This release fixes the following bugs:

- [Fix Sandstorm export board from web](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/2157).
- [Fix Error when logging in to Wekan REST API when using Sandstorm Wekan](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1279).
  Sandstorm API works this way: Make API key, and from that key copy API URL and API KEY to below. It saves Wekan board to file.
  `curl http://Bearer:APIKEY@api-12345.local.sandstorm.io:6080/api/boards/sandstorm/export?authToken=#APIKEY > wekanboard.json`
  If later API key does not work, you need to remove it and make a new one.

Thanks to GitHub user xet7 for contributions.

# v2.13 2019-02-01 Wekan release

This release adds the following new features with Apache I-CLA, thanks to bentiss:

- [Use infinite-scrolling on lists](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/2144).
  This allows to reduce the loading time of a big board.
  Note that there is an infinite scroll implementation in the mixins,
  but this doesn't fit well as the cards in the list can have arbitrary
  height.
  The idea to rely on the visibility of a spinner is based on
  http://www.meteorpedia.com/read/Infinite_Scrolling
- [When writing to minicard, press Shift-Enter on minicard to go to next line
  below](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/7a35099fb9778d5f3656a57c74af426cfb20fba3),
  to continue writing on same minicard 2nd line.

  to fix #2143. Thanks to pantraining and xet7.

This release fixes the following bugs with Apache I-CLA, thanks to bentiss:

- [Fix vertical automatic scrolling when opening a card](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/820d3270935dc89f046144a7bbf2c8277e2484bc).

Thanks to GitHub user bentiss for contributions.

# v2.08 2019-01-28 Wekan release

This release fixes the following bugs with Apache I-CLA, thanks to bentiss:

- Make the max height of the swimlane not too big](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/ae82f43078546902e199d985a922ebf7041a4917).
  We take a full screen minus the header height;
- [Properly fix horizontal rendering on Chrome and Firefox](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/7cc185ac57c77be85178f92b1d01d46e20218948).
  This reverts [commit 74cf9e2573](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/74cf9e2573) "- Fix Firefox left-rigth scrollbar."
  This reverts [commit 9dd8216dfb](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/9dd8216dfb)
  "- Fix cards below swimlane title in Firefox" by making
  [previous fix](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/2132/commits/f7c6b7fce237a6dbdbbd6d728cfb11ad3f4378eb)"
  And this partially reverts [commit dd88eb4cc](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/dd88eb4cc).
  The root of the issue was that I was adding a new div and nesting
  the list of lists in this new list. This resulted in some
  weird behavior that Firefox could not handled properly
  Revert to a code colser to v2.02, by just having the
  swimlane header in a separate line, and keep only one
  flex element.
  Fixes #2137

Thanks to GitHub user bentiss for contributions, and translators for their translations.

# v2.04 2019-01-26 Wekan release

This release fixes the following bugs with Apache I-CLA, thanks to bentiss:

- [Bugfix for swimlanes, simplify setting color, fix rendering on Firefox](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/2132).

Thanks to GitHub user bentiss for contributions, and translators for their translations.

# v2.03 2019-01-25 Wekan NOT RELEASED because of [bug](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/2126#issuecomment-457723923) that was fixed in v2.04 above

This release adds the following new features with Apache I-CLA, thanks to bentiss:

- Change [Swimlane](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/1688)/[List](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/328)/[Card](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/428)
  color with color picker at webbrowser and [REST API](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/5769d438a05d01bd5f35cd5830b7ad3c03a21ed2);
- Lists-Color: [Only colorize the bottom border](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/33977b2282d8891bf507c4d9a1502c644afd6352),
  and make the background clearer to visually separate the header from the list of cards;
- [Change Swimlane to Horizontal](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/dd88eb4cc191a06f7eb84213b026dfb93546f245);
- [Change IFTTT wizard color names to color picker](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/4a2576fbc200d397bcf7cede45316d9fb7e520dd);
- REST API: [Add new card to the end of the list](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/6c3dbc3c6f52a42ddbeeaec9bbfcc82c1c839f7d).
  If we keep the `0` value, the card might be inserted in the middle of the list, making it hard to find it later on.
  Always append the card at the end of the list by setting a sort value based on the number of cards in the list.

and fixes the following bugs with Apache I-CLA, thanks to bentiss:

- [Fix set_board_member_permission](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/082aabc7353d1fe75ccef1a7d942331be56f0838);
- [Fix the sort field when inserting a swimlane or a list](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/b5411841cf6aa33b2c0d29d85cbc795e3faa7f4f).
  This has the side effect of always inserting the element at the end;
- [Make sure Swimlanes and Lists have a populated sort field](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/5c6a725712a443b4d03b4f86262033ddfb66bc3d).
  When moving around the swimlanes or the lists, if one element has a sort
  with a null value, the computation of the new sort value is aborted,
  meaning that there are glitches in the UI.
  This happens on the first swimlane created with the new board, or when
  a swimlane or a list gets added through the API;
- UI: Lists: [Make sure all lists boxes are the same height](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/97d95b4bcbcab86629e368ea41bb9f00450b21f6).
  When `Show card count` is enabled, the lists with the card counts have
  two lines of text while the lists without have only one.
  This results in the box around the list headers are not of the same size
  and this is visible when setting a color to the list.

Thanks to GitHub user bentiss for contributions, and translators for their translations.

# v2.02 2019-01-22 Wekan release

This release adds the following new features with Apache I-CLA, thanks to bentiss:

- [Add per card color: Card / Hamburger menu / Set Color](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/2116) with [color picker](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/2117);

- [Allow to retrieve full export of board from the REST API](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/2118) through generic authentication.
  When the board is big, retrieving individual cards is heavy for both the server and the number of requests.
  Allowing the API to directly call on export and then treat the data makes the whole process smoother.

and adds the following new features with Apache I-CLA, thanks to xet7 and bentiss:

- [Translate and add color names to IFTTT Rules dropdown](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/44e4df2492b95226f1297e7f556d61b1afaab714), thanks to xet7.

  - Move home button / avatar bar from bottom to top. So at top first is home button / avatar, then others.
  - When clicking Move Card, go to correct page position. Currently it's at empty page position, and there is
    need to scroll page up to see Move Card options. It should work similarly like Copy Card, that is visible.
  - Also check that other buttons go to visible page.

Thanks to above GitHub users for their contributions.

  MAIL_URL was overriden with database info all the time.
  Now if MAIL_URL exists is not overwritten and if neither MAIL_URL nor
  exists valid admin panel data MAIL_URL is not set.
  MAIL_FROM was ignored. Same behaviour, env variable has bigger priority
  than database configuration.
  On both cases, althought environment variable is set, updating admin-panel
  mail settings will load new info and ignore the environment variable;

* Show customized error msg while invitation code is wrong during registration;
* Fix "internal error" while registration is done;

* Add high available server for getting the gpg keys - suppose it should lead
  to fewer failures on getting the gpg keys leading to some rare build failures;
* Add a docker build to the .travis.yml - this will help determine if pull
  requests need further review before merging into devel;
* Use navigator language by default instead of English.

# v0.9 2015-09-10

This release is a large re-write of the previous code base. This release marks
the beginning of our new user interface and continues to improve the overall
performance and security. It also features the following improvements:

* A new user account system, including the possibility to reset a forgotten
  password, to change the password, or to enable email confirmation (all of
  which were previously impossible);
* Avatar customization, including the possibility to upload images and to choose
  one from Gravatar or the user initials (on Sandstorm we use the avatar exposed
  by Sandstorm);
* Cards multi-selection to facilitate batch actions such as moving all the cards
  of selection, or attaching a label or a member to them;
* Automatic drafts saving synced with the server;
* Keyboard navigation, press `?` to read the list of available shortcuts;
* The possibility to restore archived boards, lists, and cards.

Starting from this release we will also distribute official docker images on
both the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/releases) and on
the [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mquandalle/wekan). We also configured
Heroku one-click install and improved Sandstorm integration with the integration
of its build-in sharing model.

New languages supported: Chinese, Finnish, Spanish, Korean, and Russian.

Special thanks to GitHub users ePirat, nata-goddanti, ocdtrekkie, and others who
have supportive during this *traversée du desert*, and to neynah for the Wekan
icons.

# v0.8

This release continues the implementation of basic features of a “kanban”
software, especially:

* Basic card attachments. If the attached file is an image we generate and
  display a thumbnail that can be used as a card “cover” (visible in the board
  general view);
* User names mentions and auto-completion in card description and comments
  (though we don’t have any notification system for now, making this feature a
  less useful that it should);
* Filter views, current filtering options are based on labels and assigned
  members;
* Labels creation and suppression at the board level (previously we had a fixed
  list of labels);
* Customization of the board background color.

This release is also the first one to introduce localization of the user
interface.

New languages supported: French, German, Japanese, Portuguese, and Turkish.

# v0.7.1

This release fixes the following bugs:

* Unexpected lost of the card sorting on the server side;
* Fix a bug during board creation;
* Focus the new list form if the board is empty.

# v0.7

This release starts the transition from a toy project to something useful. Along
with some security and performance improvements (for instance, opening a card
used to take a long time because it was re-generated the entire DOM whereas only
the popover was new). New features includes:

* Add and remove labels to cards;
* Assign and unassign members to cards;
* Archive cards (though restoration is not yet possible);
* Board stars;
* Markdown and emoji support in comments and card description;
* Emoji auto-completion in the text editor;
* Some keyboard shortcuts (eg `Ctrl`+`Enter` to submit a multi-line input).

We also introduced basic support for the [Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io)
platform, and distribute a `spk` (Sandstorm PacKage) for this release and
subsequent.
